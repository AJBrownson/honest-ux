          <p className="text-xs lg:text-[15px] text-[#A7AAB4]">
            I was born and raised in Abuja, Nigeria. Growing up, I was an active
            kid into sports, making crafts, sketching and of course, trying new
            foods! Oh, waitâ€¦ did I forget to mention I love food? My bad! ðŸ˜‚
            <br />
            Since I was little, Iâ€™ve always loved spicy meals. So, if you ever
            want to catch my attention, just invite me for a spicy lunch. Thatâ€™s
            my weakness!

            How Design Won Me Over

          <p className="text-xs lg:text-[15px] text-[#A7AAB4]">
            In 2021, I joined my schoolâ€™s internship program and tried
            everything from coding, data analysis, and even cyber security.
            Honestly, I was just throwing things around to see what stuck. But
            that same year, design caught my eye, probably because Iâ€™ve always
            loved art. <br />
            One day, I stumbled upon a Figma post filled with threads labeled
            #design. Curious, I dove in and found myself solving user problems
            by dragging shapes around. It was a bit strange, but I loved it!{" "}
            <br />
            When my internship ended, I realized design was my path. I took some
            Udemy courses (thanks, Dan Walter Scott!) and spent the last two
            years improving my skills and getting quick with the tools.

          <p className="text-xs lg:text-[15px] text-[#A7AAB4]">
            In my free time, youâ€™ll catch me jamming to my favorite playlist,
            brainstorming new ideas, and keeping up with the latest design
            trends. Gotta keep things fresh! Right now, Iâ€™m diving into motion
            design and Web3 design. Who knew design could be so lively? <br />
            When I'm not designing, youâ€™ll find me watching movies, hitting the
            gym (trying to balance all those snacks), and staying updated on
            whatâ€™s new in the design world. After all, I canâ€™t let my creativity
            go flat! <br />
            Thanks for taking a peek into my world!
